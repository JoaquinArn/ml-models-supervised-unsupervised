# Machine Learning Techniques: Supervised and Unsupervised Models

Welcome to this collection of machine learning models built in Python. This repository demonstrates core supervised and unsupervised learning techniques using real-world and synthetic datasets. Each project includes clean code, visualizations, and explanatory comments designed to improve clarity and reproducibility.

## 🔍 Contents

### 📌 Supervised Learning

- **Classification**
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Regression**
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multivariable Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression (Univariate and Multivariable)
  - KNN Regression

### 📌 Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering Techniques
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
  - Hierarchical Clustering (HClust)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Modeling & Evaluation**: Scikit-learn

## 📈 Visualizations

Each notebook includes clear visualizations to support understanding of the models:
- Scatter plots with decision boundaries
- Regression line fits
- Clustering results with color-coded groups

## 💡 Motivation

This repository was built to demonstrate core machine learning techniques as part of my academic training in Data Science at Universidad de Buenos Aires, and to support my goal of pursuing a career in top-tier companies.
